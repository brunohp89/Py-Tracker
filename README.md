# Py-Tracker
A tracker for cryptocurrencies

Hi everybody,

I have been investing in cryptocurrencies for a while and have used a variety of trackers to keep my crypto under control. I have however failed to find a free tracker that pleased me. So, for a while I was just using what I thought were less than optimal tracker to a point where I said: Why don’t I create my own tracker? And that’s what I started to do. I started developing it in July 2021 on my free time and today (27-09-2021) I finally decided to make it a public rep.
